                <h2>Pollution</h2>
                <p>Marine Pollution, including plastic waste, oil spills, and chemical runoff, severely impacts ocean ecosystems. Plastics are especially harmful as they break down into microplastics, which marine animals often mistake for food.</p>

                <h2>Climate Change</h2>
                <p>Rising ocean temperatures and acidification threateb marine life. Coral reefs, crucial to marine biodiversity, suffer from bleaching due to increased water temperatures.</p>

                <h2>Habitat Destruction</h2>
                <p>Coastal development, bottom trawling, and deforestation lead to the loss of critical marine habitats like mangroves, coral reefs, and seagrass beds, which are vital for many marine species.</p>

                <h2>Overfishing</h2>
                <p>Overfishing disrupts the balance of marine ecosystems, leading to the decline of important species. It also affects the food chain and the livelihoods of communities depending on marine resources.</p>

                <h2>Invasive Species</h2>
                <p>Non-native species introduced by human activity can outcompete native marine life, disrupting local ecosystems. This often leads to the decline or extinction of indigenous species.</p>
