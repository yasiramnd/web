        <p>Beaches are essential natural resources that provide habitat for marine life, recreational spaces for humans,
            and play a significant role in the economy. Keeping our beaches clean is crucial for preserving these

            ocean, protecting marine life and those who depend on the sea for enjoyment and food.
